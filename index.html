      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>Welcome to my page. I am a recent Computer Science (CS) graduate from CSU Chico seeking employment and looking to help people find solutions to their problems. I have a strong background in CS fundamentals and a desire to learn. I hope to be able to help whichever company of which I end up being a part. My interests outside of my academic area lie in gaming and tennis.</p>

            <p>Worked alone to self educate and then use Unity and C# to be able to create and deliver a Mario style 2d scroller game from scratch. In developing the game I leveraged free art assets from the Unity store while I developed the backend scripts. This game has three levels; a tutorial, a normal level, and a boss level.</p>

            <p>Created a complete scanner and a parser from scratch for a C based language written by Tyson Henry
    (CSU Chico Computer Science department head as of 2022), which then used C++ code to run. This compiler was implemented with over 1900 lines of code in bison and lex for parsing. Success was demonstrated by running programs of varying length to completion.</p>
